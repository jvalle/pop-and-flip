# Pop and Flip

Pop and Flip is (or soon will be) a jQuery plugin that allows you to easily animate cards to pop up (similar to [Fluidbox](https://github.com/terrymun/Fluidbox)) and flip over to reveal the back side in a modal box.

## Building Your Own

I haven't made any releases yet, because it's super incomplete, but if you want to build your own copy or help out with development, make sure you have [Node](http://nodejs.org/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/), and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) installed.

Then, `cd` into the project directory, run `npm install` to download all the dev dependencies, then run `gulp` to compile the CSS and JavaScript.

Temper your expectations at this point. It doesn't do much.
